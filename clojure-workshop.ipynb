    "The workshop makes use of the [Jupyter notebook technology](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "Seeing this page probably means the setup has been successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to evaluate a code snippet, focus on it, and click the Run button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this workshop is to get you fast into reading and writing Clojure code.\n",
    "It doesn't aim to be exhaustive.\n",
    "If you want to go deeper the Clojure path, those are a few resources that could be recommended:\n",

    "## A blazing quick introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "> Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic – every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Source</u>: https://clojure.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Key facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clojure code can compile to JVM bytecode, .Net CLR and transpile to JavaScript - ClojureScript\n",
    "* Clojure part of the LISP family of languages, making heavy usage of parens\n",
    "* It's a dynamically-typed language\n",
    "\n",
    "## Straight into the pit\n",
    "\n",
    "In most widespread languages (Java, JavaScript, .Net, etc.), this is how an addition would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 + 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how it translates in Clojure:"
